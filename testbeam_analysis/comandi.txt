the run_4.root is referred to the data run taken in November 11th with 60 degree and HV+20.

Here the line command for the analysis code:



./read_data . 4 0 -10 1 >& file4.log &

4 is the run number

0 -10 is the number of events to be processed

1 is a kind of option that actually I do not remember, I will check.


BEFORE that you have to:

source setDCDataReaderEnv.sh (change the path to your WaveDir directory)
bash compile.sh
